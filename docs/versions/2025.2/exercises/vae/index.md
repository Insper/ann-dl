**Activity: VAE Implementation**

In this exercise, you will implement and evaluate a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) on the MNIST dataset. The goal is to understand the architecture, training process, and performance of VAEs.


## Instructions

1. **Data Preparation**:

   - Load the MNIST dataset;
   - Normalize the images to the range [0, 1];
   - Split the dataset into training and validation sets.

2. **Model Implementation**:

   - Define the VAE architecture, including the encoder and decoder networks;
   - Implement the reparameterization trick.

3. **Training**:

   - Train the VAE on the MNIST dataset;
   - Monitor the loss and generate reconstructions during training.

4. **Evaluation**:

   - Evaluate the VAE's performance on the validation set;
   - Generate new samples from the learned latent space.

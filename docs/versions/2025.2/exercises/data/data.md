Generate am artificial dataset with a cloud of points and compute the distance between them. Use the following steps:
1. **Generate Data**: Create a set of random points in a 2D space.
2. **Cloud of Points**: Visualize the points as a cloud.
3. **Distance Calculation**: Compute the pairwise distances between the points.
4. **Visualization**: Plot the points and annotate the distances.

Regression is a type of predictive modeling technique that estimates the relationships among variables. In this exercise, you will implement a regression model to predict a continuous target variable based on one or more input features.

como seria em 3-dimensions? Use the following steps:
1. **Generate Data**: Create a set of random points in a 3D space.
2. **Cloud of Points**: Visualize the points as a cloud in 3D.
3. **Distance Calculation**: Compute the pairwise distances between the points in 3D.
4. **Visualization**: Plot the points in 3D and annotate the distances.

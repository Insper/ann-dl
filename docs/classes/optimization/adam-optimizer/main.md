The ADAM Optimizer

The ADAM (Adaptive Moment Estimation) optimizer is a popular optimization algorithm used in training neural networks. It combines the advantages of two other extensions of stochastic gradient descent: Adaptive Gradient Algorithm (AdaGrad) and Root Mean Square Propagation (RMSProp). ADAM is particularly well-suited for problems with large datasets and high-dimensional parameter spaces.

ADAM maintains two moving averages for each parameter: the first moment (mean) and the second moment (uncentered variance). These moments are updated using exponential decay rates, which allows ADAM to adapt the learning rate for each parameter individually.

The key steps in the ADAM optimization algorithm are as follows:

1. Initialize the first moment vector \( m \) and the second moment vector \( v \) to zero.
2. For each parameter \( \theta \) at time step \( t \):
   - Compute the gradient \( g_t = \nabla_{\theta} L(\theta) \).
   - Update the first moment: \( m_t = \beta_1 m_{t-1} + (1 - \beta_1) g_t \).
   - Update the second moment: \( v_t = \beta_2 v_{t-1} + (1 - \beta_2) g_t^2 \).
   - Compute bias-corrected moments: \( \hat{m}_t = \frac{m_t}{1 - \beta_1^t} \) and \( \hat{v}_t = \frac{v_t}{1 - \beta_2^t} \).
   - Update the parameter: \( \theta = \theta - \eta \frac{\hat{m}_t}{\sqrt{\hat{v}_t} + \epsilon} \).

Where:

- \( \beta_1 \) and \( \beta_2 \) are the decay rates for the moving averages (typically set to 0.9 and 0.999, respectively).
- \( \epsilon \) is a small constant added for numerical stability (typically set to \( 10^{-8} \)).
- \( \eta \) is the learning rate.

ADAM has become a default choice for many deep learning practitioners due to its efficiency and effectiveness in handling sparse gradients and noisy data.

Generative models are a class of machine learning models that learn to generate new data samples that resemble a given training dataset. They are particularly useful in tasks such as image synthesis, text generation, and audio generation. Generative models can be broadly categorized into two main types: explicit generative models and implicit generative models.

- **Explicit generative models** define a probability distribution over the data and can sample from this distribution to generate new data points. Examples include Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) and Variational Autoencoders (VAEs). 

- **Implicit generative models**, on the other hand, do not explicitly define a probability distribution but instead learn to generate samples directly through mechanisms like adversarial training. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are a prominent example of implicit generative models.

Additionally, there are **diffusion models**, which have gained popularity in recent years for their ability to generate high-quality images and other data types. These models work by gradually transforming a simple noise distribution into a complex data distribution through a series of denoising steps, allowing them to capture intricate details and variations in the data.

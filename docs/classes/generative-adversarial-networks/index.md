[^1] [GAN Lab](https://poloclub.github.io/ganlab/){target='_blank'} is an interactive visualization tool that helps users understand how Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) work. It provides a hands-on experience of training GANs, allowing users to visualize the generator and discriminator networks, observe their interactions, and see how they evolve during the training process. This tool is particularly useful for those new to GANs or for educators looking to demonstrate the concepts behind adversarial training in a more intuitive way.

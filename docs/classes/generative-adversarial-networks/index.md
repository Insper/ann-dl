### Detailed Highlight: Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)

Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), introduced by Ian Goodfellow and colleagues in 2014, represent a groundbreaking advancement in generative modeling. GANs consist of two neural networks—the generator and the discriminator—that are trained simultaneously through adversarial processes. The generator creates synthetic data samples, while the discriminator evaluates them against real data, providing feedback to the generator to improve its outputs.

GANs have been widely adopted for various applications, including image synthesis, video generation, and data augmentation. Their ability to generate high-quality, realistic samples has made them a popular choice in creative fields, such as art and design, as well as in scientific research for simulating complex phenomena.



[^1] [GAN Lab](https://poloclub.github.io/ganlab/){target='_blank'} is an interactive visualization tool that helps users understand how Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) work. It provides a hands-on experience of training GANs, allowing users to visualize the generator and discriminator networks, observe their interactions, and see how they evolve during the training process. This tool is particularly useful for those new to GANs or for educators looking to demonstrate the concepts behind adversarial training in a more intuitive way.
